## Reverse Image Search
This repo is for my presentation at PyData 2017.<br>

It demonstrates how to utilize [Keras](https://keras.io/)' pretrained [ResNet50](https://keras.io/applications/#resnet50) convolutional neural network and scikit-learns [K-nearest neighbors](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/neighbors.html) for a reverse image search enginer.<br>

There is no `requirements.txt` file, becuase configuring tensorflow and keras can be finicky. <br>
I ran the code use Keras with Tensorflow and just one nvidia k80 GPU.

Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5BAepEE9I8).
