## Reverse Image Search
This repo is for a presentation at PyData 2017.<br>
It demonstrates how to utilize keras' pretrained ResNet50 convolutional neural network and scikit-learns K-nearest neighbors for a reverse image search.<br>

There is no `requirements.txt` file, becuase configuring tensorflow and keras can be finicky. I use Keras with Tensorflow using 1 GPU.
